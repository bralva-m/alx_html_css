<h1>The Last Lantern</h1>
<h2>A Journey Home</h2>

<p>The Last Lantern opens on the eve of a small town’s forgotten festival, where one lantern
     remains lit against the wind. It follows Mira, who returns after years away, 
     carrying a single letter and a suitcase of old regret</p>
<p>As she walks the familiar streets, memories surface—laughter from a childhood 
    bakery, the creak of the bridge at midnight, a friendship that once meant everything. Those echoes push her
     to ask what she left behind and what she might still save.</p>

<h3>Nightfall and Resolve</h3>
<p>When the lantern’s flame falters, Mira must decide whether to relight it and face a truth she’s been avoiding, or let the darkness make the choice for her.
     The town’s people, each holding their own small light, reveal pieces of a past that could mend or break her.</p>

<p>This short novel is a quiet look at belonging, courage, and the small
     rituals that keep us tethered to one another. Read on to follow Mira 
     as she learns that glowing embers can become beacons—if you’re brave enough to hold them.</p>
